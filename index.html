            <h2>Font Properties</h2>
            <p>Although some of the properties sounds similar to text properties, think of font properties as those that
                will change the style of the font on the page. Its size, the family, etc.</p>
            <section>
                <h3>Font Properties Covered in Your zyBook</h3>
                <dl>
                    <dt>font-family</dt>
                    <dd>This is where you'll define the fonts you want to use. There should be more than one in this
                        list, and they should look similar to each other, so that if one doesn't load, another one in
                        the list will.</dd>

                    <dt>font-size</dt>
                    <dd>Allows you to control the size of the text on your page. The browser does apply some defaults,
                        so you should notice right away which elements on a page are headings and paragraphs (even
                        though we don't choose tags for style).</dd>

                    <dt>font-weight</dt>
                    <dd>You can use this property to make your fonts bolder or lighter. Usually headings are more bold
                        and text is at a normal or medium weight. Don't make your text so light or small that no one can
                        read it!</dd>

                    <dt>font-style</dt>
                    <dd>Can be used to make fonts bold, underlined, italic, etc.</dd>

                    <dt>font-variant</dt>
                    <dd>This property specifies the variant of the font, which can be set to things like small caps and
                        uppercase.</dd>

                    <dt>font</dt>
                    <dd>This is a shorthand property that you can use to set (in this order) a font's: style, variant,
                        weight, size/(optional) line-height, and family all at once.</dd>

                <h3>Using Web Fonts</h3>
                <p>There are a lot of ways to use fonts on the web. You can host your own files, or you can link to
                    fonts hosted by a service like <a href="https://fonts.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Fonts</a>.
                    Let's grab a font to use on our page for our headings. (Often, the heading font is different than
                    the one used for the body text).</p>
                <p>In Chrome, <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Seymour+One?thickness=10" target="_blank">go to
                        the font "Seymour One" on Google Fonts</a>. We're going to add this to the page. Follow the
                    steps below to use a Google Font:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Choose the font you'd like to use on your site from those shown on Google Fonts, then click on
                        the name to go to the page showing all of its styles/weights.</li>
                    <li>From that page, add the style you need by clicking on the plus sign next to them. (Just choose
                        the ones you need, the more you add, the slower your page will load).</li>
                    <li>Once all of your font styles are selected and visible in the side panel, copy the link code from
                        the sidebar, and paste it in the head of your HTML document before your link to your CSS file.
                    </li>
                    <li>To use the font in your CSS, copy the font-family rule at the bottom of the sidebar and paste it
                        into the parts of your CSS where you want to use that font. Be sure to adjust for weights if
                        necessary.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Font Sizing</h3>
                <p>There are a lot of units you can use to set sizes for all of the elements on your page, and that
                    incudes fonts. However, there are some important things to keep in mind.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Use relative units. If you use pixels, you can take away the user's ability to zoom into the
                        text or make it larger with their device settings.</li>
                    <li>Make sure that your body text is at least 1rem (which is about 16 pixels). This is a minimum
                        font size for readability/accessibility.</li>
                </ol>

            <h2>Text Properties</h2>
            <p>Text properties do have some settings that sound similar to font properties, but think of these as those
                that would do more to change the way the text layout looks on the page.</p>
            <section>
                <h3>Text Properties Covered in Your zyBook</h3>
                <dl>
                    <dt>text-align</dt>
                    <dd>This controls how the text is aligned inside of its container. Options are: left, right, center,
                        and justified.</dd>

                    <dt>text-decoration</dt>
                    <dd>This is a shorthand that controls the color, thickness, style, and kind of line used with your
                        text.</dd>

                    <dt>text-transform</dt>
                    <dd>You can use this property to convert your text to all upper- or lower-case letters, in addition
                        to other settings.</dd>

                    <dt>text-indent</dt>
                    <dd>Text indent will indent the first line of your paragraph(s). This can make it easier to scan to
                        find a new paragraph, but you can also use spacing for this.</dd>

                <h3>Line Height and Width for Text - Best Practices</h3>
                <p>These two properties are important for readability and accessibility (which means that they're also
                    important for SEO!), so be sure to follow the guidelines below.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Line height should be set to more than 1, 1.5 is a common setting.</li>
                    <li>Limiting how wide a paragraph of text is allowed to get on a screen makes it much easier to read
                        (and looks a lot better too!). Limit your text widths to 45-90 characters (that's a bog range,
                        generally I aim for 55-65).</li>
                    <li>Use the <code>ch</code> unit for setting a max width on text. We generally want to limit the
                        number of characters anyway, and this makes it easy to improve readability!</li>
                </ul>
